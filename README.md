# Learning Management System Database Design

This repository showcases the Learning Management System (LMS) Database Design project, developed as part of the "Database Design" course. The project focuses on creating a well-structured and efficient database to manage student enrollments, course information, online exams, and homework assignments.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Learn the principles of database design by creating a database for a Learning Management System (LMS).
- **Implementation:** The project is designed and implemented using MySQL and Python.
- **Course:** Database Design
- **Professor:** Dr. Momtazi

## Features

The project encompasses several key features for managing a Learning Management System:

- **Student Enrollments:** Design of tables to manage student enrollments in courses.
- **Course Information:** Database schema for storing course details, such as course name, instructor, and schedule.
- **Online Exams and Homework:** Structure for instructors to define online exams and homework assignments.
- **Data Integrity:** Implementation of relationships, keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.

## Workflow

1. Students can enroll in courses by interacting with the enrollment system.
2. Instructors can define online exams and homework assignments for their courses.
3. The database maintains a record of student enrollments, course details, and assessment materials.

## Usage

To explore this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/leilibrk/Learning-Management-System-Database-Design.git`
2. Review the database schema and SQL scripts to understand the structure and relationships.
3. Experiment with the provided Python scripts to interact with the database and simulate the LMS workflow.
